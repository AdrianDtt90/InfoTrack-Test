# InfoTrack-Test
This is the test-project for the interview with the company InfoTrack.

## Product
Basically the application display a Google Results Search where the user enter an url and keywords to get a result of how many times and in what positions a certain URL is found according to a certain search.
Also the user will be able to see a list of the results history and when they did every search.

## Considerations
I developed in Visual Studio 2019, so my recomendation is using it and open it in the same version.

## Development
This project consist in the frontend part (developed in ReactJS-Redux) and the backend part (developed in C#).
Both have unit tests (frontend with Jest and backend with NUnit). 
For running the solution, first open the NuGet Console and install all the dependencies with "Update-Package -reinstall".
After that, just press Play, reacts is already compiled.

I could have developed the frontend separately with the backend as an APIRest and make request to the endpoints, but I thoungh that the application was quite small to develop it in that way so I ReactJS-Redux part in the View section of the C# solution.
